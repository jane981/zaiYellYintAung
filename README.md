# Hello, I'm Zai 👋

I'm a passionate software engineer and aspiring entrepreneur. My journey in the tech world is driven by a strong desire to create innovative and elegant products. My ultimate goal is to build a unicorn startup by the age of 23 and make a lasting impact on the world.

## About Me

- 💼 Currently immersed in the field of web development, I specialize in modern tech stacks like Next.js, Svelte Kit, MERN, MEVN, Django, and Ruby on Rails.
- 📚 I'm an avid reader and lifelong learner. Books are my source of inspiration and knowledge.
- 🏋️ When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the gym, as I believe in maintaining a healthy body to fuel a sharp mind.
- 🎵 Music is my passion, and I'm on a journey to master the piano and guitar.
- ✈️ Traveling the world, paragliding, and becoming a skilled storyteller are some of my life's quests.
